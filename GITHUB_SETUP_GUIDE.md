# GitHub Setup Guide for Options Trading Bot 2026

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com (make sure you're logged in as schmoll86)
2. Click the green "New" button or go to https://github.com/new
3. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `options_trading_bot_2026`
   - **Description**: "Automated options trading bot with IBKR integration, bull/bear/volatility strategies"
   - **Visibility**: Choose "Private" (recommended for trading bots)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions.
Look for the HTTPS URL, it should look like:
```
https://github.com/schmoll86/options_trading_bot_2026.git
```

## Step 3: Add Remote and Push Your Code

Run these commands in your terminal (I'll help you with this):

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/schmoll86/options_trading_bot_2026.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Verify Your Code is on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/schmoll86/options_trading_bot_2026
2. You should see all your files uploaded
3. Your `.env` file should NOT be visible (it's in .gitignore)
4. The `.env.example` file WILL be visible with all configuration placeholders

## Important Security Notes

✅ **What's being uploaded:**
- All Python source files (*.py)
- Configuration examples (.env.example)
- Documentation (README.md, this guide)
- Requirements file
- Service configuration

❌ **What's NOT being uploaded (protected by .gitignore):**
- Your actual .env file with API keys
- Log files
- __pycache__ directories
- Virtual environment (venv)
- Any credentials or secrets

## Next Steps for Ubuntu Deployment

Once your code is on GitHub, you can easily deploy to Ubuntu:

1. **SSH into your Ubuntu server**
   ```bash
   ssh your-user@your-ubuntu-server
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/schmoll86/options_trading_bot_2026.git
   cd options_trading_bot_2026
   ```

3. **Set up the environment**
   ```bash
   # Install Python 3.11 if needed
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv
   
   # Create virtual environment
   python3.11 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the bot**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit with your actual values
   nano .env
   ```

5. **Set up systemd service**
   ```bash
   # Copy service file
   sudo cp trading-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/
   
   # Update paths in service file if needed
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/trading-bot.service
   
   # Enable and start the service
   sudo systemctl enable trading-bot
   sudo systemctl start trading-bot
   
   # Check status
   sudo systemctl status trading-bot
   ```
