## Recent Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. VIX Data Collection Issue ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** VIX was removed from `market_indexes` list but still referenced in `_get_technical_sentiment()` method, breaking volatility strategy.

**Root Cause:** The `sec_type` parameter wasn't supported throughout the IBKR client chain, preventing VIX (Index) data collection.

**Solution Applied:**
- Added `sec_type` parameter support to all client components:
  - `async_sync_bridge.py` ✅
  - `ibkr_timeout_wrapper.py` ✅ 
  - `async_sync_adapter.py` (already had support)
  - `thread_safe_ibkr_wrapper.py` (already had support)
- Re-added VIX to `market_indexes` list in `news_handler_2026/news.py`
- VIX now properly handled as Index (`sec_type='IND'`) with CBOE exchange

**Impact:** Volatility strategy now fully functional with accurate VIX data.

### 2. Web Monitor Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED
**Added Features:**
- **Dark theme** with green accents (#4CAF50) for professional appearance
- **Real-time activity log** showing bot decision-making process:
  - NEWS: Market sentiment updates, VIX levels, sector analysis
  - SCREENING: Stock screening results and candidate selection
  - STRATEGY: Bull/Bear/Volatile strategy execution decisions
  - EXECUTION: Order placement, fills, position management
  - RISK: Risk limit checks, position sizing decisions
- **WebSocket-based real-time updates** for instant data streaming
- **Scrollable activity log** (500px height) with timestamps

**Impact:** Complete visibility into bot operations for monitoring and debugging.

### 3. News Handler Improvements ✅ ENHANCED
**Changes Made:**
- Replaced individual sector stocks with sector ETFs for efficiency:
  - XLK (Technology), XLV (Healthcare), XLE (Energy)
  - XLF (Financials), XLY (Consumer Discretionary), XLI (Industrials)
- Enhanced market sentiment analysis with VIX integration
- Added fallback mechanisms for data reliability
- Improved parallel data collection for faster updates

**Impact:** More reliable and efficient market sentiment analysis.
