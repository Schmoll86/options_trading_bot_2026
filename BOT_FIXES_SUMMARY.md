# Bot Fixes Summary - Execution Context Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Client ID Conflicts
**Problem**: Bot was using a fixed client ID (10) which caused "client id is already in use" errors when restarting.

**Solution**: Implemented dynamic client ID generation using timestamp + random number:
```python
unique_client_id = (int(time.time()) % 900) + 100 + random.randint(0, 99)
```

### 2. Market Data Timeouts
**Problem**: Bot was timing out when requesting market data, especially for SPY.

**Solutions**:
- Increased timeout from 5 to 15 attempts in `async_handler_2026.py`
- Added support for using bid/ask mid-price when last price not available
- Better error handling and logging during data retrieval
- Use delayed data mode (reqMarketDataType(4)) for reliability

### 3. Error Handling in Execution Engine
**Problem**: Execution engine would crash when market data wasn't available.

**Solutions**:
- Added graceful fallback to NEUTRAL sentiment when no data
- Better handling of missing close prices
- Reduced sentiment thresholds from 1% to 0.5% for more responsive trading
- Made VIX data optional (continues without it if unavailable)

### 4. Screening Performance
**Problem**: Stock screener was requesting data too quickly, overwhelming IBKR Gateway.

**Solution**: Increased delay between market data requests from 2 to 3 seconds in `simple_sync_screener.py`

## Running the Bot

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure IBKR Gateway is running on port 4001
2. Make sure you have market data subscriptions
3. Use a paper trading account for testing

### Quick Start
```bash
# Test market data first
python test_market_data.py

# Test execution engine
python test_execution.py  

# Run the full bot
python run_bot_simple.py

# Or run with output to file
python main_sync_with_web.py 2>&1 | tee bot_run.log
```

### Monitoring
- Web interface: http://localhost:5001
- Log files: `bot_run_*.log` with timestamps
- Check for "Market analysis complete" messages to confirm it's working

### Troubleshooting

1. **"Client ID already in use"**
   - Wait 30 seconds and try again
   - The bot now uses dynamic client IDs to avoid this

2. **"No data for SPY"**  
   - Check IBKR Gateway is connected to servers
   - Verify market data subscriptions are active
   - Try during market hours for best results

3. **Bot not trading**
   - Check logs for "Market sentiment" messages
   - Verify "Market is OPEN!" message appears
   - Look for "Found X candidates" in screening results

### Key Improvements
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- Better timeout handling for market data
- Graceful degradation when data unavailable
- Dynamic client IDs to avoid conflicts
- Improved logging for debugging

### Next Steps
1. Monitor the bot during market hours
2. Check that market data is being received properly
3. Verify screening is finding candidates
4. Watch for actual trade execution (currently limited by strategy implementation)
